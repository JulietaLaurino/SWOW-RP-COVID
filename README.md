# SWOW-RP-COVID

The [Small World of Words project (SWOW)](https://smallworldofwords.org/project/) project is a scientific project to map word meaning in various languages. In this repository you will find the analysis pipeline for the Rioplatense Spanish SWOW-COVID study, in which we aimed to explore the collective changes in the mental lexicon as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were obtained in December 2020, and compared with responses previously obtained from the Small World of Words Rioplatense Spanish database ([SWOW-RP, Cabana et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02070-z)).

Suggestions are always appreciated, and do not hesitate to get in touch if you any questions.
